			<h1>The Concepts of Nursing<h1>
			<h2>Caring and Conclusion<h2>
			<p>Along with the interview with Emmanuel, there was a second interview that had taken place, this time with Adam McGruther, a University of Michigan nursing graduate. He also works in the Emergency Department at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI but he is the charge nurse is that department. Over the summer of 2012 he took in a nursing student as an intern and was in charge of teaching her the things she needed to know about the hospital itself and then nursing procedures in general. Over the time that he taught her all of these things he was asked what his favorite part was about teaching interns the aspects of nursing. He responded to this by saying, “Over anything else, the thing I love most about teaching these interns is that it reminds me of when I was a nursing student doing what they are. I understand the pressure and everything that they are going through so it allows me to not only teach them but to build a relationship and help them with their schooling as well.” Just like most nurses, Adam has a caring heart. This is just one of many benefits that this career has. It allows them to build relationships with other nurses, doctors, and their patients. Having a caring heart is the backbone of nursing. </p>
			<p>The discipline of nursing has tons of details that make the career special. In its own way reading, research, communication, technology, and writing have become a more prominent resources than ever before. With every piece of new technology these resources have to adapt and the level of nursing become much more difficult. The overall degree of nursing is a wonderful choice by any person but they have to have the will power to succeed in this industry. There are going to be times when this career becomes overpowering and stressful but like any job, it is something worth fighting for. Nurses truly make a difference in this world.<p>
