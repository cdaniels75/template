			<h1>The Epidemic of Teenage Pregnancy</h1>
			<h2>Background Analysis</h2>
			<p>The thoughts and beliefs of America have been changing even before being declared a free country. It took the leaders of this nation to change their minds and work together to help shape the society we live in today. Without the amount of discussion, wars, and argumentative discussions that this nation has been through, the change would not have taken place, and the country would be how it was many years ago without any change what so ever.  <p>
			<p>As a country our thoughts upon how we view the world are constantly being altered. This can be supported by the epidemic of teenage pregnancy that has been occurring for the past decade. Less than a century ago, a woman was not allowed to go out in public without wearing conservative clothing and depending on the family or religion practices, also not able to be seen without a male authority figure. This fact can be used to explain how the family could potentially feel about teenage pregnancy; if their women were not even allowed to be in certain circumstances without being covered or supervised, getting pregnant at a young age was certainly frowned upon. If one looked at the world as we see it today, the way women dress in public looks nothing like how it was less than a century ago. For example, women today wear extremely revealing clothing, are not tied down as much by the male standard, and it is socially acceptable to be in public while pregnant.  People from the past would be astonished to see the world as it is today because of the amount of change that this nation has gone through. <p>
