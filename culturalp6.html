			<h1>The Epidemic of Teenage Pregnancy</h1>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>The world has gone through drastic changes in its lifetime with the most current and prevalent one being the acceptance of teenage pregnancy. Looking back at people in the twentieth century they understood things completely differently than how people see things now. Girls that shopped in the maternity section of stores were looked down upon and now it is almost normal to see young girls shopping there. It comes down to how Americans have went about advertising their products, their perception of a perfect life, and the television shows that have all of these ideas incorporated in them. It is not healthy for the parents, family, friends, or the development of the next generation to keep showing these types of programs on a device that is used every single day for most people. Action needs to be taken in parenting and in the entertainment industry to make this problem come to an end. </p>
