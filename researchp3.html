			<h1>The Concepts of Nursing<h1>
			<h2>Communication<h2>
			<p>On top of being able to endure immense amounts of pressure, students must have communication skills that are required in order to succeed when they are enrolled in nursing courses. This major is well organized so students can ask for help from their teaching assistants, professors, tutors, or other students that are potential study group partners. Without some of these resources it is very difficult to succeed in this specific discipline. Professors understand that the student is going to have questions on the material that is being taught, which is why they have office hours that they encourage students to take advantage of. If they expected the student to know the material thoroughly then they would not offer the office hours that they have. Study groups are an essential part of college. Many students form study groups within their classes and major so that they can help each other with the material that is expressed in lecture. There may be something that several people do not understand that a few in the group may be able to explain.  Students must also be able to ask for tutors when it is needed. Tutors cannot guess what the student is having a problem with so they need to be able to explain their problem to those that are trying to help them.</p>
			<p>In the actual nursing classes, where you start to do patient care, students must have proper communication skills because now they are making conversations with patents, the patient’s family, doctors, other students, and the nurse that is teaching them how to do certain procedures. They have to be able to talk to a patient respectfully when the patient is being belligerent or screaming in pain, because even though that select patient is having an “issue” it is the nurse’s job to try and solve the situation as efficiently as possible without having any issues. It is also disrespectful to the patient if the nurse is not paying full attention to the patient when they are listing their issues. Yes, a lot of people exaggerate things and that is what most people assume, especially when it comes to pain, but if the nurse does not take in consideration that patient is in pain, then it could completely disrupt the diagnosis of that patient. These rules also apply, not only in nursing school, but in the hospital after receiving the degree as well. Every patient needs to be treated with the utmost respect at all times, no matter what the circumstances are. <p>
