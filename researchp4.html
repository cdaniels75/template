			<h1>The Concepts of Nursing<h1>
			<h2>Writing<h2>
			<p>The amount of writing during clinicals can be excessive but everything that is written down must be recorded in order to ensure that the patient gets the exact treatment that they need and deserve to make them healthy again. Some examples of these types of writings are triage reports, care plans, and nursing diagnoses. A triage report is usually created when the patient comes into the office or hospital. Nurses will ask the patient why they are coming to the hospital, even if it is evident, their pain scale, which is usually based on a scale of one to ten. The patient is taken to a room and the vitals are tested: heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen intake, respiration rate, and body temperature. All of this information is submitted into the computer and sent to the doctor so he or she can make the primary diagnosis for the select patient. This process is repeated for every patient that is seen.</p>
			<p>Unlike a doctor, a nurse cannot make official diagnoses such as Cardio Vascular Disease, Diabetes, Cancer, or any type of disease for that matter because these are actual medical conditions. Nurses can only make nursing diagnoses which are completely different. These are broader and based on the disease that the doctor thinks the patient has. They list anything they can think of that they patient may get in the future. For example, some nursing diagnoses would be increased risk for infection, skin integrity, disturbed body image, or something along those concepts.<p>
			<p>A care plan comes after the nurse examines the patient. After meeting with the patient, the nurse will then look up the pathology of their disease and comorbidities. Once they have this piece of information they can start thinking about the problems it will pose for the select patient (the nursing diagnoses). For example, someone with an open wound would have an increased risk for infection. Once the nursing student has identified the main problem(s) they then come up with goals for that patient. The next step of this process are they will have nursing interventions (what the nurse will do to help their patient achieve these goals). Then the nurse will evaluate how well their patient has achieved their goals. These types of reports are crucial to understand and be able to prepare for those in nursing school and nurses who already have their degree. <p>
