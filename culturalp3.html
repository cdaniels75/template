			<h1>The Epidemic of Teenage Pregnancy</h1>
			<h2>Description of the Issue</h2>
			<p>Looking at things from a more recent point of view, the technology that has been made is much more modern than anything ever invented before. Picture a basic three bedroom house. Most families have a television in every bedroom of the house and on those televisions are where these shows are being played. Sometimes it is hard to turn on the television and surf the channels without seeing at least one advertisement or show that has some connection to teenage pregnancy.</p>
			<p>Part of the reason why it is acceptable to see teenagers pregnant is because of the advertising involved with pregnancy. Commercials on television are starting to involve younger looking women in them to try and adapt to the ones who will buy their products because there are more young people starting to have families than those who are slightly older. On top of commercials on television, there are several television shows that express teenage pregnancy. According to Wikipedia, there are 21 known television shows that clearly express the epidemic of teenage pregnancy but not in a positive way. Some of these reality shows such as “Teen Mom 1, 2, and, 3”, “16 and Pregnant”, “Too Young To Be a Dad”, and “The Secret Life of an American Teenager” seem to make it acceptable for teenagers to be get pregnant and start a family. In reality, this is completely unacceptable. <p>
			<p>Teenagers should not be getting pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant. Not only does it put the mother and father at a high stress rate for the rest of their lives, but it affects the family as well. The families of both parties are now also involved with the wrongdoings of the teenagers and are also partially responsible for the child. For the rest of their lives they are going to have to take care of a human being, all because these two teenagers thought it would be a good idea to start a family based on the television shows that they had been watching. Eventually they will realize that they have made a terrible mistake and want to change the outcome. Too bad this isn’t something that can be reversed. This decision they have made is permanent. <p>
			<p>Going back to the thought of “it would be nice to start a family at this age” teenagers have not yet realized that this is not a perfect world and nothing lasts forever. The actors and actresses on television may make it seem like a perfect world with their happy family, nice house, and good jobs but in reality this process is a lot more complicated than it is portrayed to be. Typically relationships do not last forever, and most relationships that have a child involved at a young age will not last, especially if they are not married. Having a family is not all it is portrayed to be either. After the couple comes home from the hospital they now have to deal with a baby that needs to be fed regularly, cries constantly, and needs its diaper changed multiple times per day. This baby becomes this couple’s first priority whether they choose to accept it or not because this child cannot take care of itself. <p>
			<p>Another downside to having a child as a teenager is that the parents, primarily the mother, may start to slip in school. On top of getting an education, doing their homework, and trying to stay in touch with friends and family they now have this “nuisance” to deal with. Most teenagers have a goal in life at this time, but with having a child this goal or dream becomes significantly harder to accomplish. High school is one thing to try and cope with while a child is present, but as that child gets older and the parents are getting into their college years this becomes a lot more difficult. In high school, it is possible to pass with a C average because it still allows that person to graduate. In college the quality of work will increase and standards will be raised, making the situation harder for an average student, let alone someone who is expecting or has a child to care for.  <p>
			<p>Some teenagers also get a glorified picture of life based on what they witness on television. What person would really strive to have a life broadcasted on television like that? It shows the world that that individual got pregnant and made one of the biggest mistakes of their life that could have been prevented. It is more embarrassing than a pleasure. It is also very selfish, using a baby to make yourself known. Even if these people did get famous, who would want to be known as that girl/guy on television that got pregnant on a television show? It is not something that an individual should be proud of. Accomplishing a lifelong goal that impacts the future in a positive way is something to be proud of, and getting pregnant at a young age is not along those lines.<p>
