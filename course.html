			<h1>Course Retrospective</h1>
			<p>“You fail only if you stop writing.” This quote is an easy resemblance to one of the writing classes here at MSU. Writing takes place every day whether people realize it or are oblivious to the fact. The writing class that will be explained is WRA 110 Science and Technology. This WRA class not only teaches students how to use the correct form and technique when writing papers but also builds character. Students going into the technical fields that contain several different math, science, and technology based classes are encouraged to take this scheduled class because it focuses on these certain concepts. This class also prepares you for the technical concepts that students will learn in the future when they are going through their undergrad. The class incorporates several thinking skills that these students will need for their schooling and their career.</p>
			<p>So many people are worried about first year college classes, especially the writing based classes. All the rumors that some classes require a twenty page paper with a deadline of a week seem so psych students out and give them extreme amounts of anxiety. In reality, these writing classes are meant to help students with their writing and not stress the out. This class is really nothing to worry too much about because they give you plenty of time to work on the paper and projects before they are actually due. The topics may seem vague at times but they are supposed to be because it is a beginner’s writing class, not an advanced one. Although they give you more than enough of time to do the assignments, it doesn’t mean that you should wait till the last minute to do them. It will only end in extreme amounts of stress and Procrastination is never a good idea. Just make sure to be on top of your assignments and everything will run smoothly in the class. It is as simple as you decide to make it. <p>
			<p>In order to be successful in this specific writing class there are certain things that a student should be aware of, these include: style, technique, and background information on basic  technology. This class will go over smoothly if these are qualities that the student possesses before they begin the class. There is a paper that focuses on the students choice of major and potential future, this project is the lived experience paper. For instance if the student is a pre- medicine major, it would be beneficial to know the many instruments that are used in a doctor’s office and hospital, because in order to write the paper efficiently, they must be able to describe the objects that they are speaking about because the reader may not know much about the piece of technology. The background knowledge just makes the papers easier and swifter to write. <p>
			<p>The technique of the papers in this class is just like those of basic paper that one would write for an entrance exam. The student must be able to write in different formats and these include, formal, semi-formal, and informal. All of these qualities are used. Although the majority of students are taught not to use the words “I”, or “you” in papers, in this class there are quite a few times where this is acceptable: the lived experience, remix memo, and parts of certain assignments. Students need to understand that it is acceptable to use these words as long as it is approved by the teacher. These words are now appropriate to use in certain circumstances. <p>
			<p>Another skill that would be beneficial to have is the basics of computer software and website design. In this class, a requirement is that for every project or paper they student makes, a web version is also required. Having some sort of knowledge with website work with make this class a lot less frustrating and less time consuming. On top of doing these web assignments for the papers and projects there is a website called codeacademy and students have to complete the web fundamentals section. This also comes with ease if you have a background in this specialty. Those who don’t have a background in web design will be able to succeed but at a greater difficulty. Codeacademy is designed to help those that do not know how to create a website, but this program can be very confusing and frustrating at times. This is the reason why some knowledge of web design would be recommended. <p>
			<p>After obtaining these skills, the easiest part is to adapt them to your writing. As mentioned before, the Lived Experiences project is the biggest eye opener of the semester. It really makes you think about why you chose the major you did. Everything must be described in great detail because there are people that will not know what you are talking about. My paper was about my choice to pursue nursing and the reason why I chose it was because of my fear of needles. When most people think of needles, they think that they are all the same typically; it was my job to describe them in detail and express how this affected me in such a positive way. Without these key details, no one would understand what exactly was going on in my paper. <p>
			<p>Another paper that you will write is the Cultural Analysis paper and this explains a social issue. If you want my advice, pick something easy that has an argument to go along with it such as gun control, teenage pregnancy, or even something political. This paper was probably the easiest out of the bunch because you get to voice your opinion on the subject without getting too heated or in a debate. This essay can be lengthy, but overall simple. Make sure to cite your sources using MLA or APA format. There are websites for this, one of the most popular being citationmachine.net. All you have to do is copy and paste the information and it spits out a citation. How easier could it get?<p>
			<p>The most time consuming, and most difficult paper that you will encounter for this class is the Formal Research essay. It is by far the longest, by approximately 1,000 words and has the most criteria needed for it. Advice for this paper would be to talk to people about your major from your specific department, because you will need to do interviews for it anyways. What I did was I went to the hospital that I previously interned at over the summer and interviewed a few of the nurses that I had worked with. Resources come in various shapes and sizes, you just have to know how to use and recognize them. For this paper you also have to incorporate different types of writing and quotes from those in the profession. Advice for this is, go to the library and seek help from them. They know the most about being able to find these documents and also give incite on which ones to use. Try to find the resources you need to be successful, they’re out there.<p>
			<p>Unlike the other projects, the Remix project involves not only a paper, but a video as well based on the topic that you choose to focus on. For this project instead of working by yourself, you get to work with other classmates which makes this project a lot easier. Team work is key for this project. Make sure you and your group members get along and your schedules can correlate or else it will be a long, hard, and stressful working period. Having the skills to make and edit a video is not mandatory, but could really help with this project. Just like the formal research project, this project can involve interviews to get different points across to the audience. Communication is key during this project, not just with the people in your group but with others as well in order to get the point across to the audience.<p>
			<p>Ultimately, this class will prepare you for the future here at Michigan State University. Not only will it enhance your writing skills and aspects, but it also will teach you time management, responsibility, team work, social, and communication skills. This class is a great building block for incoming freshmen because it teaches you all that you will need to know and more for writing papers in college, where the most important thing to consider is your detail and description. Without proper usage of these concepts, the audience will not know what the paper is about and then the point is lost. This class will teach you how to use all concepts the proper way, but this one specifically. It is also a great class to start with in because it eases you into the college lifestyle. It’s a difficult class at times but it is not something that is doable for every student.  <p>
