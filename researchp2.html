			<h1>The Concepts of Nursing<h1>
			<h2>Schooling and Advice for School<h2>
			<p>Many jobs in the medical field are at a high demand in the United State right now. It is assumed that for every one doctor seven nurses are needed to fulfill all the patient’s needs within the hospital. This is the reason why the demand for nurses is growing. According to usnews.com there is supposed to be a twenty-six percent employment growth increase by the year 2020. Although the demand for nursing is significantly high, it is becoming more difficult for students to become nurses. The amount of knowledge that these students have to obtain to get into nursing school and pass the standardized nursing exam, NCLEX, is extraordinary. Eligibility for the exam is determined by the NCLEX board of nursing and is different for all individuals. The passing rate for the exam is also in a safe zone but that does not mean that everyone who takes it will pass. The questions given in this exam have more than one right answer; every question is a trick question where one answer is better than the other.  </p>
			<p>Prior to the NCLEX, there is nursing school and prior to that there is the pre-requisites that need to be taken before being admitted to the college of nursing. Every college is different but the course material for being a nurse is the same. Everything learned up to the point of nursing school is based upon science and human development classes upon entering nursing school you then take all of the information provided from the previous classes and adapt them to the actual nursing classes.<p>
			<p>Looking at this more in depth, students looking to get their degree in Bachelors in Science and Nursing from Michigan State University, would have to take a required number of science classes that prepare them for the college of nursing at that institute. These students are required to take in chronological order Chemistry 141 (general chemistry) their first semester at Michigan State University, Biology 161 (general biology), Anatomy 350 (special class dedicated to prospective nursing students) at the same time during the second semester, Physiology 250, Organic Chemistry 143 the third semester, Microbiology 201, and Pathophysiology 300 during the fourth semester. This is a total of seven science classes that they have to take within two years of their degree. On top of these science classes they also have to take electives and university credits. This schedule is very complicated and extremely time consuming. These classes are rumored as “weaning out classes” for those who cannot handle the pressure that goes on in the future schooling for this degree. This schedule is made for those that can cope well under pressure at times when time is of the essence. Many people that sign up for this discipline at Michigan State University are very unaware of the situation that they are going to endure, but there are few people that know the amount of pressure that they are going to be under either because they have been informed or learned about it on their own. <p>
			<p>After pre-nursing school the students then go to the college of nursing to fulfill their hope of getting a Bachelors in Science and Nursing. In this advanced stage of the schooling, students are going to class, and also going to nearby hospitals to take classes. These classes are called clinicals. They take place in hospitals and test the student’s ability on basic and critical care of patients, where they perform procedures and work with the machines that Registered Nurses use in hospitals now. Specifically, at Michigan State University, these nurses travel to various hospitals ranging from those in East Lansing, all the way to downtown Detroit, Michigan. On top of these classes being a distance away from campus, they can also be at various times throughout the day on any day of the week. This can also be very stressful for nursing students in the sense that it may potentially be a far distance from campus and the times could interfere with other activities.<p>
			<p>An interview was taken place recently; in this interview a nurse was asked several questions about school and his career. Emmanuel Tolentino has been a nurse for two years and currently works at Henry Ford Main Campus in Detroit, Michigan as an emergency department nurse; he is a Wayne State University nursing graduate. What advice would you give to nursing students? “Nursing is a great career choice. You must have realistic expectations and work from the bottom up, but eventually you will be in the area you want and be proficient at what you do. Also, remember that anyone can perform the tasks. What differentiates you is that you must possess the critical thinking skills to make decisions in terms of patients care. Lastly, there are three rules. 1.) Safety (for yourself and your patients) 2.) Control your environment 3.) Be an advocate for your patient.” This advice is crucial in every setting whether it is clinical, or after the student graduates. How did you handle the stress as a nursing student? “By ensuring I spent just as much time decompressing as I did studying. This would include doing things I enjoy such as hanging out with friends, watching movies, or other hobbies. Something that could separate you from thinking about school.” Many students in the nursing program tend to over study at times which can actually cause problems within the subject. Over studying tends to cause the brain to go on overload and start deleting the information that it has previously retained. His advice should be taken into account for students and to replace what he did with what the student enjoys to do. In this interview Emmanuel gives distinct advice mainly to those who are nursing students, but also to new nurses that are undergoing stress as well. <p>
