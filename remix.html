			<p>The issue that we used in our project was that of Gun Control. This project made me understand that people are very bitter and serious about this situation. My personal views got in the way with this project quite a bit because I am very outspoken about them so doing research on the topic was not the easiest thing to do. The organization process was not that hard, other than deciding what goes where in the video. One other problem was finding a time where all of us could meet, especially with finals week coming up. Our schedules are completely different and it was extremely difficult to meet, but we made it happen.<p>
			<p>Our group thought that it would be a good idea to use a social issue this way the audience could take part in the project as well and be able to think about the issue as a whole after seeing other people’s opinions. The most challenging part of the project was finding information that was not too vulgar, but at the same time true. Since this project is on gun control a lot of the information can stun some people and we wanted the topic to go over as smoothly as possible. YouTube was an excellent source for all of our videos but as for our facts and statistics, we used one website in particular to gather the information from. It was a simple website with practical information on gun control. The least beneficial websites for this project were those that took the situation in an indifferent approach. This was because they didn’t declare appropriate information; it was not practical and we could tell that it was something that could be questioned.<p>
			<p>Our group for the most part was very easy to get ahold of, and very responsive as well. We created a group chat on our phones the first day we got into a group this way we could talk about the project when we needed efficiently. Although it was difficult to meet at times we made it work and were able to work efficiently to get the task at hand completed. Working in groups for this project was very beneficial because it takes teamwork to put a video together. It also helps because some people are better at the technology based aspects of learning than others, so making the video, at least for me would have been extremely difficult. I am really glad that we had groups for this project. <p>
			<p>The game plan that we had for the project did change quite a bit but overall we had a generalized idea of what we wanted to do from the beginning. We all agreed on what went into the video and we all contributed information, which was also beneficial so not just one or two of us was doing all the work. If we had more time on the project I am sure that the effects would have been more extreme instead of the basics that the software we used offered. More audio would have been added and the quality of the video as a whole may have been slightly better. <p>
			<p>The objective of our designs was to make it eerie and slightly dark because of the topic at hand. Using black backgrounds would show the darkness and despair of guns. Guns have the potential to take the lives of people so black would be a good color to show and respect those that have passed. We made our decisions based on the group and the respect for our audience. We tried not to incorporate videos that could be offensive or scolding to others.<p>
			<p>Overall the project was a success by everyone in the group and the participation and cooperation was significant. Everyone put in the time that was needed to make the project as smooth as it could be. I enjoyed working with the members in my group.<p>
