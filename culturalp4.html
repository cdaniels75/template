			<h1>The Epidemic of Teenage Pregnancy</h1>
			<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
			<p>There are minimal solutions to this problem. One of them is to eliminate the sources of the entertainment industry that support teenage pregnancy. Showing these types of things on television is the reason why this is happening. Millions of people look up to those that are famous or on television, and a couple on television that is having a child is not something that kids or teenagers should be looking up to. They should be looking up to those who have driven this country in the right direction, not those who have made mistakes and their lives are making the entertainment industryâ€™s money.<p>
			<p>Another solution to this problem would be the parenting skills of these children. Even though these television shows have been on air, parents need to enforce to their children that sex will lead to cases like these and to stay away from it until they are stable part of their life with a significant other and can afford to have a child. Parents now are so young and inexperienced that they forget to enforce the simple things like bad words, and behavior. Bad behavior such as sex will lead to babies, because that is what sex is supposed to do, just not for those who are young and have their whole lives to live.<p>
