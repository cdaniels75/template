			<h1>about me</h1>
			<p>The purpose of the video was to inform people that suicide is not the right way to go about handling their problems.</p>
			<p>The video attempted to achieve its purpose by having the male in the video show great emotion and sadness towards his uncle that committed suicide.</p>
			<p>The structure of the video was more of the person telling a story to the audiance rather than reading a letter. He told the story, showed emotion, and then tried to convince that there are other ways to handle problems.</p>
			<p>This video can help me with my essay because by watching it I can see that I'm not supposed to just be writting an essay, but more telling a story that gets the readers attention.</p>
