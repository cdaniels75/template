			<h1>The Concepts of Nursing<h1>
			<h2>Reading and Research<h2>
			<p>Communication and writing skills are two of the must haves for those interested in pursuing a career in the field of nursing. Another skill that these people need to obtain is reading. Reading seems like a simple thing to do, but in reality it is not, especially when someone’s life depends on it. For every medicine, treatment, examination, or assessment that a nurse does, they get an order from the doctor that has the patients list of allergies on it. If a nurse does not thoroughly look at this piece of paper and see the allergy list, this patient is now at a high risk of having a severe reaction. Given a situation where a nurse is treating a patient that has a simple migraine and all that patient wants is some pain medication and food, the nurse will put in a request for the doctor to send an order to the nursing station to get these wishes fulfilled. The doctor then approves it and tells the nurse to give the patient what they need and order them food, what this nurse doesn’t know is that their patient is allergic to Tylenol (a pain medication) and peanuts because the nurse did not look at the paper he or she was given when the orders were made like they should have. She then orders them a turkey sandwich, a juice and peanut butter crackers and administers a pill of Tylenol to the patient. This patient is two minutes away from going into shock and having a life threatening reaction, all because of the nurse that didn’t look at the bottom of the page. This is why it is crucial for the nurse to be able to look at things and read them in full. This comes into play when they are administering any medication, looking at the diagnosis, or any other time when reading is an important part of the patient’s health.</p>
			<p>Reading is so much more than being able to read and analyze words on a piece of paper or computer screen. In the medical field there are certain charts and machines that all heath care professionals need to be able to read. One example of this is the machine called an Electro Cardiogram. This machine measures the hearts electrical activity in the body by a series of waves that are traced on to a piece of paper for the doctors and nurses to analyze so they can properly treat the patient to make them more comfortable with their disease. They also need to be able to read charts such as tox-screens, which show toxicity levels in the body; these can include all types of drugs including alcohol that present themselves at an abnormal level inside the body’s blood supply. Without the knowledge of being able to read these types of graphs, a patient would not get the proper treatment.<p>
			<p>There is one more type of reading that a nurse must be able to use every day that they are on the job and this only gets better with practice. Nurses must be able to read their patients to find out if they need to be monitored, can be left alone, or transferred to another unit. This may come into play if a person seems belligerent, or very uncooperative. A very simple version of this would be if a nurse is assigned a patient and who is asking for pain medication. It is a sad thing to say, but most of the time medical examiners assume that the patient is lying until they see proof that the patient is in pain. This is because of the people that abuse the health system and come in to just get medication for their personal use. The nurses will use the body actions to determine if the patient needs the medication. A more complicated version of this would be when a nurse is assigned a patient who has had a surplus of alcohol that evening and is well over the legal alcohol limit. The nurse has to watch this patient closely so they do not get out of bed, because they can potentially hurt themselves and the others around them. They monitor verbal and physical actions to do this. Some of these patients experience a lot of attention because they can potentially start problems with the staff and other patients. The nurses constantly monitor the patient’s attitude and if they feel at any moment it is getting out of hand, they will put them in a Mental Health Ward until they become sober so they are no longer a threat to the staff or the safety of the patients. This kind of reading is essential in the field of nursing because it is all about the patient’s safety, and that is what everything ends up circling back to. It is a special kind of reading but just like anything else, with practice. <p>
