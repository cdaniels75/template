			<h1>The Epidemic of Teenage Pregnancy</h1>
			<h2>Summary of the Problem</h2>
			<p>There has been a huge increase in the past decade involving pregnancy. People are calling this era the "baby boom" but is this a good thing? The answer is no. This surplus of babies being produced is not being caused by not only families, but teenagers as well, and in this case more teenagers are getting pregnant than the families are. This problem is something that needs to be taken care of before it gets too out of hand, even though it already has. There are ways that this epidemic can be fixed but it will take a lot of effort and time that is at the essence. <p>
