			<h1>The Epidemic of Teenage Pregnancy</h1>
			<h2>Anticipated Results</h2>
			<p>Unfortunately this is not as easy as it sounds. The entertainment industries have made so much money off of these shows to just get rid of them now, so the idea of eliminating them is not going to happen without a fight. Even though these shows will not be omitted from television, people can still refuse to watch them. If enough people stop watching them, then they will be taken off of the air just like all the old television shows that have become old and used up. Television shows will find something else to play on air. As for parenting, if people just increase their concern for their childâ€™s future and stress these issues and prevent them from seeing these things on television, the problem will slowly cease. It is going to take a while because of how prominent this problem has become, but eventually the problem will take care of itself and come to an end. People just need to realize that it is there and to take action against it.</p>
