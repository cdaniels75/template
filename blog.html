			<h1>Blog entry #1</h1>
			<p>Ok, so i take this class thinking it is going to be the most significant to my career in nursing, but turns out its a class where you write about different kinds of technology. Even though most of my papers are going to be based upon machines in the medical field i dont see how this class in particular is going to help me in my career as a nurse. It is one of those classes where they say you need it but in reality you really don't need it to succeed. It is just a way for them to make you take an extra class; On the bright side of this situation, id rather be writing about different kinds of technology than African culture, or Women in America; that class would bore me to death and its probably a topic that i would fall asleep while writing about. I'm a good writer so I'm pretty sure that this class will be fairly simple for me, at least i hope it will be. I really don't need any more extremely hard classes at the moment. I'd end up going insane or going through nervous breakdowns every night, neither of which is good for mine or anyone's health.</p>
			<h1>Blog entry #2</h1>
			<p>Today seemed like a pretty easy day in class since all we did was make our online accounts and submit our papers to Eli. The one thing I cannot stand about this class though is the amount of websites that it uses. I miss when everything used to be in a textbook and you would do the work, write the information down, type it up and hand it in. This whole, " I think its a good idea to put assignments online and have my students submit them irks me. Why should I have to go on multiple websites to do different assignments related to the one topic we are discussing? I mean if professors are going to start making us do our stuff online, I strongly believe that it should be on one website or through email. This class alone has Github, Elireview, D2l, and who knows what else is coming. My other classes have online work too and it makes me go insane sometimes because I never know where to go for what class because I have so many different cites to use. MSU needs to reevaluate this concept. <p>
			<h1>Blog entry #3</h1>
			<p>3 words. I HATE GITHUB. This website is probably the most confusing thing I have ever laid my eyes upon. You have to "fork" things, which I guess is a copy and paste option and I dont understand why they just dont call it COPY AND PASTE. It is a simple concept but they word things completely insane. I personally think it is the most rhetorical concept I have ever laid my eyes upon. On top of that, they have THE WORST set up ever for Windows. The Mac set up is a piece of cake because I saw someone do it at the library but no the windows version must have been made by the devil because there is no way that one person would be able to do this by themselves. My laptop is also telling me that my source cannot be found when I tried to open my blog. Excuse me, but I think that after I spent hours trying to configure this program my blog should be somewhere. It is the simple things about this class in general that I don't seem to understand. <p>
			<h1>Blog entry #4</h1>
			<p>So I guess that this guy wants to relay a message to his Uncle about how he let him on this Earth without anyone to be there for him because just as he experienced being shunned by the family before killing himself this kid is now too. He is going through the same life experiences that traumatized his uncle before he passed. The video achieves his purpose by the use of a letter and the broadcasting involved. He hoped that some way some how his uncle would see it and he probably did so, but obviously from a distance. This video taught me to make my lived project personal and no one can tell me my opinion is wrong because it is my story, whether people choose to accept it or not. The structure of the message was very adamant. The author made his point very strongly without any vague points at all.<p>
			<h1>Blog Entry #5</h1>
			<p>I turned in my project, without many corrections only because my rough draft was rated a 50/50 which I am extremely proud of. I am confident that my paper will have a positive final grade and that the professor will likethe flow of my paper. It was not one of those generic papers where the beginning immediately runs into what the paper talks about but instead starts with an interesting topic that begins the nice flow on the primary subject of my paper. I am pretty sure that the prof will appreciate my narrative not only because my story is touching but it also shows how much a nerd I really am, which I think is kind of funny how I incorporated it into my paper. I kind of figured that this class would be kind of simple but I am scared that it will get harder as the class progresses. I am almost sure that i will achieve my goal of having a 4.0 in the class. <p>
			<h1>Blog Entry #6</h1>
			<p>The role of women in the tech industry has dramatically increased; earlier in the decade is was primarily a man's job but now women are getting involved in such activities. They have proven that a it is something that not only men can do but women as well, and sometimes even better than the average male worker. Women have been advancing in the world since the beginning of the 18th century ( the 1900's). Even though they are advancing in the tech industry, some employers still prefer to hire men over women because it was originally a man's job and people are still in that specific mindset, which is wrong but will not be ignored by some people. As, a woman I believe there should be no special treatment what so ever and using the tech industry as an example, men still get paid a certain amount more than an average female worker because it was believed that it was a man's job to take care of the household, but no a days we have women that are single parents and women that are living on their won as well so why should men get special treatment? This is something i have always wondered when it comes to certain jobs and their picture of what the industry should look like and how their pay role is set up.<p>
			<h1>Blog Entry #7</h1>
			<p>There are times that this class can tend to be very frustrating and today is one of those days. I wish i had some type of Codeacadmey background because half of the time i have no idea what they are talking about. it would have been really helpful to have taken that project last year in AP lit where we made a website, because then i wouldnt be having sucha a hard time with this. It is definitely something i would recommend to someone before taking this class.<p>
			<h1>Blog Entry #8</h1>
			<p>it is so nice only having to go to class once per week but at the same time, it tends to be super annoying that we stay in class so long. Id sooner take a class that is three days per week and has 50 minutes each lecture period. Im not one for the hour and a half long lectures. I get super aggitated if i sit in one spot too long. i was always that kid in elementary who could never sit still and always had to walk around. this class is the only one that i have that lasts this long and its the longest hour and a half of my life. <p>
			<h1>Blog Entry #9</h1>
			<p>this code stuff will be the death of me. and i dont understand why i need this type of stuff for my major. i will be treating patients when i am older, so why am i paying to take a class where i have to make websites? it just doesnt make sense to me. all i would like to do is take science clases because i am actually going to use and retain that knowledge. it just doesnt make sense to me. not only do i feel this way about his class but also a few of the other ones that i have to take uch as iss and iah classes. there is no way i will ever use them ever again. <p>
			<h1>Blog Entry #10</h1>
			<p>as each day passes, i am looking forward to the next semester. there is just something about my schedule that i cannot stand right now and i am sick of ll my classes. a paper here a paper there, some owl, and now my stats professor decided to add on web work in the middle of the semester. and now that we have a group project in this class coming up i have no clue what i am going to do. talk about being overstressed. <p>
			<h1>Blog Entry #11</h1>
			<p>i hate group projects. the only thing that makes me more upset than an early deadline is having people in a group that dont do the work. luckily we get to choose our groups so im not too worried about our project. im sure it will be fine, the only issue that i am currently worried about is the times and dates of when we will be able to meet and get this thing done. i know it wont take long as long as we all cooperate and decide as a group.<p>
			<h1>Blog Entry #12</h1>
			<p>i am so happy that we do not have a final in this class. it is going to make that week before break starts so much easier knowing that i have one less thing to worry about especially since i have everything done for the rest of the semester in this class except for my code stuff but that will not take too long to conquer. im all done in my chemistry class except for my exam and stats im just hopng to do well in. for some reason that class is not as easy as it should have been. im doing decent but not as well as i should be doing.<p>
			<h1>Blog Entry #13</h1>
			<p>as this class comes to a close i really think i will miss it, only because of it being such an easy class to begin with. i am naturally good at writing papers and getting things in on time, so this class wasnt all that hard for me. i really wish some of these aspects came naturally to me though. such as the coding. that was probaby the hardest part about this class. it was just so difficult to understand at times because it is just not what i am used to. i now give credit to those going into that field because i could never do this again.<p>
			<h1>Blog Entry #14</h1>
			<p>this final project is going to be a piece of cake. especially since the group i am in for the web part of it is with all my friends in the class so it shouldnt be too hard of an assignment. the only tricky part is going to be combining all of our ideas into one massive one, which even then wont be too hard because the way they were talking makes me think that we have the general concepts in line. the paper doesnt seem that hard either. its literally just talking about everything we have done during the whole semester. im sure ill be fine.<p>
			<h1>Blog Entry #15</h1>
			<p>overall i kinda enjoyed this class. not so much the work, but becasue of the flexibility that came along with it. only haveing class once a week, long deadlines, and easy assignments was a very easy way to make the switch into college. i just was not used to the lack of discipline because my english teacher in high school was very strict, and gave no mercy to anyone unless it was within reason. so i guess you could say that this class was much easier than anything i have endured in high school. it was nice to take a break from all the hard stuff and relax a bit.<p>
