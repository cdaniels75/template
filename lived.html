		<h1>The biggest fear, is fear itself.</h1>
		<p>“Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.” At some point in everyone’s life there is a time where they are scared of something, whether this may be an object, a person, a thought, or just the fear of failure depends on the individual. With that being said, each person also handles their fears differently: some need the help of others while another group of people may cope with them on their own and challenge their fears to try and get rid of them. Fear has several ways of representing itself as well, this can occur by internal or external thoughts and this also depends on that individual and the fear itself.</p>
		<p>When I was a kid I was exposed to a lot of hunting weapons including knives and guns because a lot of people in my family enjoyed going big game hunting. I was never scared of knives or pointy objects until I encountered my first visit to the doctor’s office.  My mom had made the appointment for me to get my yearly physical, which at the time I thought was no big deal, especially since all my friends had told me that you get a lollipop after the office visit. I got out of school early that day so I could go to my appointment; when I arrived is when everything started to founder. I walked in, my hands are shaking, I started to sweat, and this was all because of the word that the nurse had said, “shots”. Although I was never scared of sharp pointed objects before, the fear of being stabbed with something so jagged went through my whole body. As I walked into the observation room my symptoms started to gradually get worse. The amount of sweat that was being produced was insane because staring at me from the other side of the room were two needles. The nurse walked into the room and from the minute she saw me knew exactly what was going on. She talked to me for a few minutes about school and friends and then I remember that she grabbed the needles and set them next to me. Just as I was starting to calm down, all my nerves shot back up and I was right back where I started, a nervous wreck. She tried to explain to me that these were not going to hurt and of course being a stubborn little kid, I didn’t listen. She told me that if I turned my head away from the needles she would show me that it really doesn’t hurt without actually administering the shot. I listened and as I did this I felt a pinch and she told me that’s all it would feel like. As soon as I turned around both needles were empty and a sigh of relief left my mouth. If it was not for that caring nurse, I would probably still be petrified of needles. <p>
		<p>From that moment on, I knew what I wanted to do with my life. I may have been young but after that experience, I knew that becoming a nurse would not only be a good thing for my future but I would be able to be that person that helps people get through the tough times in their life when they need someone the most. Having to cope with the fact that you may be dying, scared of a procedure, or just needing someone to hold your hand while you get an immunization is the reason why I wish to help people. Being exposed to such a wonderful nurse at such a young age is the reason I want to continue and be the best nurse that I can be.<p>
		<p>In my senior year of high school I got a volunteer opportunity at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan in the Emergency Medicine Department on the midnight shift; I jumped on the opportunity to go and see nurses and follow them first hand. This activity lasted about 8 months and every weekend I would go into work with my mom and follow the nurses around to see what I was getting myself into. Throughout this experience I learned how to do almost every procedure on a patient that a registered nurse does in the emergency room, and even go do some of the procedures under supervised conditions. I became fascinated with needles. There are so many different sizes, colors, and techniques to every needle and with each one, there is a different way they are used. Some are for people with tough skin, others for people that have very thin skin, and some of them are used to administer different kinds of medicine. It is crazy to think that one little needle can be used in so many different ways, but what astonished me more was the fact that all these nurses knew what kind to use and why to use it. They would show me how to use them and have me practice using them on oranges in order to really understand the concept behind each one.<p>
		<p>Not only did the needles interest me, but so did the preparation of the procedure as well. There were so many steps in getting it all right, even though it did not always work one hundred percent of the time. One of the nurses gave me a tourniquet to try and put on and it wasn’t easy; I couldn’t believe how difficult and time consuming some of the simplest looking steps were. They always made everything look so easy when in reality, it is the complete opposite of what it all seems. By the end of my time there, my knowledge increased twenty times more than it was before, especially because when I started I thought that all needles were the same and in reality they are all different.<p>
		<p>To think that my whole preparation for my career started from a visit to the doctor’s office is impeccable. I was once a scared child who feared anything that had to do with medicine or a hospital of any kind to someone whole will potentially work in one in the near future. There are certain people in life who believe in making a difference, not only nurses but those who help others daily: teachers, counselors, or even the average person on the street. I want to be one of those people that strive to do the best in life, but on a medical standard. Helping kids, adults, families, and others by just being there after they get the news from the doctor or other care giver would make my life one worth living.<p>
