		<p>	In the United States today it is difficult to go anywhere without seeing some piece of modern technology.  Innovative technology is all around us: whether it’s a light-up billboard, a navigational GPS, or a passerby with their face buried in the newest version of the Apple IPhone.  Since technology is involved in so much of our everyday lives, it is very easy to take the impact it may have on us for granted.  The use for most of these new inventions is to make life simpler and to make us more efficient but, technology we use can also be influencing us in ways we may not even realize.  The technology we use can play a major role in the choices we make and the ways in which we go about living without us even realizing it.  One major impact technology had on my life, without me noticing, was by helping me decide on a career path.
	I was a first semester student here at Michigan State University.  Moving into the college community and lifestyle was a very big adjustment for someone coming from a life spent in public schools and living at home, dependent on four other family members.  Living in a community with a lot of other first year students in the same boat as I was, I found one major recurring concern amongst us all was declaring a major.  Whether it was deciding what you want to go into or realizing that what you were doing then was not what you wanted to be doing, it was a big decision to make.  As a college freshman I felt obligated to declare a major.  The thought of coming to a university with no plan or direction for studying was nerve racking.  When I was in high school science and math classes were always favorites of mine and so the decision to major in engineering seemed to be the best.  Engineering has an eclectic collection of disciplines from mechanical, to environmental, to biological, to civil.  The list goes on and on.  Each discipline is very different in terms of their content, where one may get a job, and the types of classes one may need to take but, they all include aspects of math and science.  The trouble was that it is very hard to choose which one to study so I decided to choose Engineering-No Preference.  Luckily for me, I now believe that I have it all figured out now and I can thank modern technology for that but, it wasn’t until very recently that I realized that was the case.  I knew that I was interested in becoming a mechanical engineer and with the beginning of this assignment I realized that it was the technology I was exposed to that caused me to make that decision.
		
 	Engineering 100 is a course any student at Michigan State University must take in order to pursue majoring in engineering.  This course is not concentrated on a single engineering discipline because it is an entry level course and many students taking it are not yet sure of which type of engineering they want to choose to study.  The course is concentrated on the general aspects that are part of almost any engineering career instead.  As a No-Preference major it was comforting to know that I was not going to be pressured to study a discipline I didn’t wish to and that taking this course may help me decide which discipline I will study or if I want to study engineering at all.  One aspect that almost every discipline of engineering requires is teamwork.  The first project requires four students to work together building and 100 is designed to prepare beginning engineers it is constructed with two large group projects.  The first project requires four group members to program a single Lego NXT robot to navigate a course and perform the given tasks.  Through my interactions with the NXT program and the physical robot I discovered that Mechanical Engineering was definitely what I wanted to do.
The Lego NXT robot is more or less just a toy kit sold by the Lego toy company but, the professors at Michigan State have found a way to incorporate it into their 100 course to teach students like me the basics of engineering.  The kit includes a multitude of Lego parts, a program download for the software, and a ‘brick,’ where programmed commands are uploaded for control of the robot.  After downloading the NXT software onto a computer it can be used to program the robot to perform any given task, as long as the robot has the adequate structure attached to it.  This piece of technology combines aspects of mechanical engineering and computer engineering.  
As a group we were required to program and construct a robot to follow a white line around a square course, identify and grab hold of a foam cube, identify a light source, and then return to the start position.  Using the program we had to add in the specific commands to tell the robot to line follow, move forward or backward, use a light sensor, and turn left or right.  Once the program was completed it was then necessary to equip the robot with the right structure to complete the job.  This meant that it was going to need wheels to move, motors to power the wheels, a light sensing device, a color sensing device, and a way to grab hold of the cube.  Troubleshooting prototype structures that best suited the robot to complete the tasks at hand is what I liked most about the project and I discovered that I really had a knack for it as well.  Since I enjoyed constructing the robot’s structure and apparatus’ so much I realized that I wanted to be a mechanical engineer.
Mechanical engineering, though a very broad discipline which incorporates many aspects from other disciplines, is rooted by the need to design and manufacture everything.  Mechanical engineers work on designing and constructing computer components to aircraft.  Whatever the object is, it is likely a mechanical engineer had something to do with it.  Mechanical engineers take ideas for products and turn them into real life which requires a basic knowledge of the thing they are working on, understanding or physics and thermodynamics, and a knack for aesthetics.  Since mechanical engineers work with almost anything that moves, whether it’s a vehicle or a prosthetic body part, the fact that I truly enjoyed constructing the NXT robot proved that I was meant to become a mechanical engineer.  
 The culmination of my love for math and science, the ideas expressed from the NXT robot project, and what I knew about mechanical engineering led me to make a decision for my career path.  Technology is constantly growing and changing the way we think and live.  Today technology seems to be changing at a rate so fast it can be fairly simple to get swept up and not realize the impact it may have on everyday life.  Whether it is streaming videos from a mobile device to a flat screen television without a cable or aiding in the decision process of a career to choice, technology today is helping us in more ways than one.
