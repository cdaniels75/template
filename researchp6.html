			<h1>The Concepts of Nursing<h1>
			<h2>Trade Journals and Articles<h2>
			<p>Nurses must have: “The use of modern technology to make health and care services more convenient, accessible and efficient to become widespread.” This information comes from the trade journal titled “Are nurses expected to have information technology skills?” written by Dowding. The concept that nurses need to have proper technology skilled makes sense based on when thinking about the example used in reference to the Electro Cardiogram. Not only do nurses need to be able to read and analyze the results of the machine, but they also need to be able to know how to use it and when to use it in order to get accurate results. The Electro Cardio gram is one of many machines that nurses need to be able to use in a doctor’s office or hospital setting. Another example of technology would be any type of IV pump. In order to use these correctly nurses need to know how to enter the correct amount of medicine to be injected into the person in a given time period. Without this knowledge the patient could be at high risk for toxicities and deficiencies of the medications they are supposed to be receiving.<p>
			<p>“It is acknowledged that both the academic and clinical components of nursing programs have the potential to act as stressors for students...” This quote comes from the summary of the scholarly article “Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing” written by Timmins. This article describes the mental health involved with students in nursing school. Stress truly does take effect on those that are exposed to massive amounts in a minimal amount of time. Going through four straight years of indecent amounts of stress can make one person’s health go from completely healthy all the way to an extreme mental stage where they need medical help to return to a healthy state. Not all people have the same results, some people end up with a mental disorder and others have minor problems such as: breakouts, anxiety attacks, or even getting sick. There is also a possibility that these circumstance do not exist in some individuals. Although this does not happen to everyone, it is a possibility to those who enter nursing school.<p>
